# Telling the Story
The objective of PELE Storytelling is to simplify the traditional act of production while still telling an effective story. This section will shed some light on the structure of narrative.

## Structuring
### 3-Act Structures
Let’s review the 3-Act Structure, the standard formula for storytelling:

### Our 3-Act Plumbing Analogy
Following this structure and applying proper creative elements, an audience is guaranteed to be engaged in the three-act story arc. Let’s return to our highly-relatable plumbing analogy:

### PELE Storytelling Sections
Instead of using three acts of storytelling (which generally happens quite naturally), PELE Video Storytelling simplifies the sections of content required to efficiently tell a story:

### 1. INTRODUCTION	  -   2. INFORMATION	  -   3. ENGAGEMENT


## Focusing on the Objective
As we will come to see, what we capture in the introduction section is not necessarily the first act of the story; similarly, the footage we capture for our audience engagement section will not always be the final leg of our story.

PELE Storytelling helps us focus on the content we need so we don’t lose sight of our goals.

### The Four Components
By restricting our concentration to three main sections with our four main components—CHARACTER, ENVIRONMENT, FORCE, RESULT—we can hone in on capturing the important details necessary for informing and captivating our audiences.

### Exploring My Four Components
Here's a chance to brainstorm. No worries if you're not sure just yet, we'll ask you these again in a few pages.

#### How we will we get to know CHARACTER onscreen?

#### How will we see/hear the ENVIRONMENT?

#### What will FORCE look like?

#### How will we see FORCE's effect on CHARACTER+ENVIRONMENT?

## Sections
### Eyes on the Prize
Telling a story can be fun but also overwhelming with all the potential a new world can offer. Remember, all successful storytelling will connect audience members to characters onscreen and later leverage that empathy in a call-to-action (the message). 

### Three Acts = Three Sections
Let’s take a look at what happens we mix a typical three-act story with PELE Storytelling:

The goal here is not to confuse you with possibility (we save that for later, in the CREATIVE ADDITIONS chapter). Rather, it’s important to start conceptualizing our story in the form of our storytelling components and the sections through which we will collect them.

All PELE Storytelling really does is divide a story into three sections for answering specific questions related to our four main components. </div>
