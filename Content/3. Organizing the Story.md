# Organizing the Story
Let’s take our project (a service, event, product, charity, etc) and approach it as if it has a life of its own. Somehow, either directly or indirectly, it is meant to affect people and/or their environments. That’s what gives it *value*, and that’s why audiences will interact with it.

## Message
### Call-to-Action
In order to share our message, we will demonstrate the value derived from our project and use the story we are telling to communicate the effects of our project on its demographic. 

Our _message_ will be the call-to-action to the audience once they are engaged with our story: buy a product, subscribe to a service, join a club, make a donation, etc.

#### My story's message is...

## The Four Main Components
PELE Storytelling boils down a story into four main components, in a sequence like this: in an ENVIRONMENT, a CHARACTER is disrupted by a FORCE that leads to a RESULT.

### The Analogy of the Plumber
As an example, let’s imagine a house with broken plumbing. The wet, leaky house is our ENVIRONMENT causing distress in our CHARACTER. The plumber finally arrives with his services as the FORCE that saves the day. Our RESULT is fixed pipes and relief:

### Relating to the Audience
The CHARACTER will represent the demographic affected by our FORCE—remember, that’s the thing we’re selling—which means we want to relate to our audience here with a similar culture, language, habitat, et cetera. This demographic is paired with its ENVIRONMENT, the CHARACTER’s current reality before the FORCE enters the picture.

### Problems & Solutions
In PELE Storytelling, our FORCE is a solution to the conflict which engages the audience to receive our *message*. Our FORCE will offer a solution to our CHARACTER’s problem, meaning that the *tension* our audience experiences will be conveyed through a vulnerability wrought of our CHARACTER’s relationship with their ENVIRONMENT.

## My Story Components
In as few words as possible, let’s now define our four components:

#### Who is my CHARACTER?

#### What is their current ENVIRONMENT like?

#### What is the FORCE that comes along to affect them?

#### What is the final RESULT?

## Preliminary Components

#### Who is this video meant to be seen by?

#### What should the viewer feel called to do after watching this video? Why?
